# RUST GUESSING GAME

A simple guessing game build with Rust base on the [Rust official documentation book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)



## How it works
Here’s how it works: the program will generate a random integer between 1 and 100. It will then prompt the player to enter a guess. After a guess is entered, the program will indicate whether the guess is too low or too high. If the guess is correct, the game will print a congratulatory message and exit.
